# Coming soon
Honey on Tap is on a global mission to make honey a standard for exchange.  Why? Simply put . . . honey lasts forever, promotes wellness,  and we need our beloved pollinators to ensure our communities health alongside earthly abundance.

We’re teaming up with collaborators & volunteers from around the world to create a rainbow system of interconnected and interactive playgrounds for our communities. Each playground will promote learning and teaching in the areas of sustainable gardening, bee tending, creative building, upcycling and more! 

We currently have 7 spaces across the country all of which will have unique honey on tap systems installed. Our ministry is also deeding over properties and collaborating with the proper stewards grandly capable of creating real ‘sweet’ transformation through their efforts in upcycling, bee-tending, creative building, wellness initiatives & productions. 

We’d love to hear from you and keep you in the buzz. Sign up for updates below!

Stay sweet! <br/>
The Honey on Tap Team
